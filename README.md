# Revanced Build
This repo template will allow you to build ReVanced using Github Actions. This will helps people who don't want to setup build environments on their machines.
By default this will build ReVanced with ALL available patches. Follow [this guide](PATCHES_GUIDE.md) to exclude/customizing patches for your build.

## Notes
- The script will download the **latest available version** of Youtube on UpToDown, **NOT** latest official version on Google Play.
- While this template will build Revanced Music Non-root, it won't work as current patches doesn't include the Music Non-root (microG) patch (track [this PR](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches/pull/22) when it will get merged to `main` and released). Don't open an issue here. Just rebuild ReVanced when music microG patch is available on [ReVanced Patches](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches/releases).
- Under **NO CIRCUMSTANCES** any APKs will be uploaded to this repository to avoid DMCA.

## How to setup
1. Fork or create a new repository using this repository as a template ([Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)). DO NOT FORK if you need to set the new repo to private.
2. That's it! You can now build ReVanced using Github Actions.

## How to build
1. Go to Actions -> All workflows -> ReVanced Build ([Example](images/workflow_run.png))
2. Run the `build` workflow (try to use `experimental_build` if the logs show not all patches applied correctly while revanced is not yet released)
3. Download the APKs from the draft releases ([Example](images/build_release.png))
